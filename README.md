### Issue(s)
- AntDesign loads but without styling.

### What I want to achieve
- use AntDesign anywhere inside the project with simple `import {ComponentName} from 'antd'`

### What I have done
- import css inside both src/components/App.tsx and src/components/index.tsx
- set rules at webpack.config.js
- add dependency to package.json
- disable cache in Chrome
